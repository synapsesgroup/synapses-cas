## Differences between Synapses CAS and the original RubyCAS

[0001] Fixed the location of translations path at "localization.rb"

[0002] Configuration default_locale parameter is used now.

[0003] You can switch between locales clicking on flags at login page. The locale is passed by parameters (?locale=pt) in URL.

[0004] The selected locale is saved in current session.

[0005] To start the cas server, you must type "synapses-cas" instead of "rubycas-server"

[0006] Default theme has been completely rewrite to use twitter bootstrap, including flash messages (error, success and info).
